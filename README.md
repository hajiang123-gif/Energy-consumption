Project Title: Energy Consumption Impact Per Capita: A Comparative Analysis of China, India, and the USA

Project Descripition: 
This project compares the environmental impact per capita from energy consumption between three countries: China, India, and the USA. Using data from various global sources, the project aims to understand the disparities in energy use and its associated carbon footprints. The analysis leverages data visualization and statistical methods to present a clear view of the differences across the nations. The goal is to provide insights into how each country’s energy consumption patterns impact their overall carbon footprint.

Motivation / Objective:
This project is motivated by the need for better understanding of energy consumption’s role in global carbon emissions. By analyzing the energy consumption of China, India, and the USA on a per capita basis, we can identify trends and disparities that could guide future energy policies and climate actions aimed at reducing global emissions.
